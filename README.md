# Synopsis

Earthquke data was collected from the US Geological Society webite (<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/">earthquake.usgs.gov</a>). The range of data on the interactive map is earthquakes in the last week with a magnitude greater that 2.5.

** Reading the Graph
The size of the maker is based on the recored magnitude of the earthquake. However, due to the curvature of the eath the magnitudes are disproportionate as you get further from the equator in either hemishere. The color of each marker shows the depth of the earthquakes as indecated in the legend in the bottom right. 

Click on any earthquake marker to see the location, magnitude and depth.
